I dived deeper into computer science topics which intoduced me to code, the primary factor that all technolgy is built upon and l loved code ever since. I am fueld with my passion for understanding systems and how they were built, how they work and their intended purpose. I consider learning as a life long activity because if you are not growing you are basically decaying. My hunger for knowledge and determination to apply it drove me to leave conventional academics for more practical uses of technology because i could make real change. I taught my self and never tired all the way because i loved making software. I belive in mindfullness, being engaged with whatever i am doing and has led be to the habit of spending most of my day infront of screens expect when i am cycling or playing football.

This is my inspiration to being a developer\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause i can build anything i want. Software makes a real\n\t\t\t\t\timpact in peoples lives from blogs the shares awesome\n\t\t\t\t\tstories that inspire people to ecommerce stores that enable\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople to shop at the comforts of their homes to health\n\t\t\t\t\tsystems that diagnose patients for free imporoving the\n\t\t\t\t\tquality of lives to search engines that save us years of\n\t\t\t\t\tcollege and expenses that go with to social media that\n\t\t\t\t\tconnects people.\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Life</span> was meant to be easy and the{\" \"}\n\t\t\t\t\t<span> internet </span> has made it and is still simplifying\n\t\t\t\t\tlife for us. Soon we would not have to work and the robots\n\t\t\t\t\twill be working for us as we sit back and read.\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div className={classes.story}>\n\t\t\t\t<Typography variant=\"caption\">Background</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t<Typography variant=\"h3\">\n\t\t\t\t\tFollowing my Passion and Likes\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t<Typography variant=\"h5\">\n\t\t\t\t\tConventional eductaion did not serve me as i expected, I\n\t\t\t\t\tfailed terribly in school in topics like history, biology,\n\t\t\t\t\tchemistry and this impacted my view on life but this all\n\t\t\t\t\tchanged when i joined college and pursued what i liked,\n\t\t\t\t\tComputer Science. I started excelling to the point where i\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscovered that doing what you love makes success a joke and\n\t\t\t\t\tlife a game so i have been playing since 2018. I dived\n\t\t\t\t\tdeeper into computer science topics which intoduced me to\n\t\t\t\t\tcode, the primary factor that all technolgy is built upon\n\t\t\t\t\tand l loved code ever since. I am fueld with my passion for\n\t\t\t\t\tunderstanding systems and how they were built, how they work\n\t\t\t\t\tand their intended purpose. I consider learning as a life\n\t\t\t\t\tlong activity because if you are not growing you are\n\t\t\t\t\tbasically decaying. My hunger for knowledge and\n\t\t\t\t\tdetermination to apply it drove me to leave conventional\n\t\t\t\t\tacademics for more practical uses of technology because i\n\t\t\t\t\tcould make real change. I taught my self and never tired all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe way because i loved making software. I belive in\n\t\t\t\t\tmindfullness, being engaged with whatever i am doing and has\n\t\t\t\t\tled be to the habit of spending most of my day infront of\n\t\t\t\t\tscreens expect when i am cycling or playing football. I\n\t\t\t\t\tbelive i have found my meaning in software. Apart from my\n\t\t\t\t\tfull time commitments am takle interesting freelance\n\t\t\t\t\tprojects for client facing different challenges.

First i did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot have a liking to cramming lots of information without\n\t\t\t\t\thaving prcatical applications but at the same time i wanted\n\t\t\t\t\tto make them proud. I wanted to build things so i could be\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled an engineer but i hated physics. Until i left high\n\t\t\t\t\tschool and my world expanded i discovered that i can learn\n\t\t\t\t\tto build software. The path is not conventional compared to\n\t\t\t\t\tother engineering fields as in this field you are not\n\t\t\t\t\tdependant on someone to teach you but you own curiosity\n\t\t\t\t</Typography>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t<Typography variant=\"caption\">My Principles</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t<div className={classes.principles}>\n\t\t\t\t<Paper>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Typography> Effectiveness</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t</Paper>\n\t\t\t\t<Paper>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Typography> Learning is Life Long Process</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t</Paper>\n\t\t\t\t<Paper>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Typography> Consistency</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t</Paper>\n\t\t\t\t<Paper>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Typography> Know your Users</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t</Paper>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div className={classes.contact}>\n\t\t\t\t<Typography variant=\"h4\">LET'S WORK TOGETHER</Typography>\n\t\t\t\t<Typography variant=\"body2\" className={classes.text}>\n\t\t\t\t\tNeed a simple website or web application built or maybe some\n\t\t\t\t\tadvice on how to approach your problem?
